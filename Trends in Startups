-- Test query

-- SELECT *
-- FROM startups;

-- Calculate the total number of companies in the table.

-- SELECT COUNT(name)
-- FROM startups;

-- ==> 70


-- We want to know the total value of all companies in this table. Calculate this by getting the SUM() of the valuation column.

-- SELECT SUM(valuation)
-- FROM startups;

-- ==> 974455790000

-- What is the highest amount raised by a startup? Return the maximum amount of money raised.

-- SELECT MAX(raised), name
-- FROM startups;

-- ==> 11500000000	REBU

-- Edit the query so that it returns the maximum amount of money raised, during ‘Seed’ stage.

-- SELECT MAX(raised), name
-- FROM startups
-- WHERE stage = 'Seed';

-- ==> 1800000	Voice2Txt

-- In what year was the oldest company on the list founded?

-- SELECT name, MIN(founded)
-- FROM startups;

-- ==> RICE Media	1994

-- Return the average valuation.

-- SELECT AVG(valuation)
-- FROM startups;

-- ==> 15974685081.9672


-- Return the average valuation, in each category.

-- SELECT AVG(valuation), category
-- FROM startups
-- GROUP BY category;

-- 4290000.0	/ no category
-- ...
-- 2150000.0	Virtual Reality

-- Return the average valuation, in each category. Round the averages to two decimal places.

-- SELECT ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2), category
-- FROM startups
-- GROUP BY category;

-- Return the average valuation, in each category. Round the averages to two decimal places. Lastly, order the list from highest averages to lowest.

-- SELECT ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2), category
-- FROM startups
-- GROUP BY 2
-- ORDER BY 1 DESC;

-- ==> 380490000000.0	/ Health Care
-- ...
-- ==> null / Video Streaming

-- What are the most competitive markets? First, return the name of each category with the total number of companies that belong to it.

-- SELECT category, COUNT(name) AS number_of_companies
-- FROM startups
-- GROUP BY category;

-- ==> null / 3 companies
-- ...
-- ==> Virtual Reality / 2 companies

-- Next, filter the result to only include categories that have more than three companies in them. What are the most competitive markets?

-- SELECT category, COUNT(name) AS number_of_companies
-- FROM startups
-- GROUP BY category
-- HAVING COUNT(name) > 3
-- ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- ==> Social / Mobile / Education

-- Let's see if there's a difference in startups sizes among different locations.  What is the average size of a startup in each location?

-- SELECT location, ROUND(AVG(employees))
-- FROM startups
-- GROUP BY location;

-- What is the average size of a startup in each location, with average sizes above 500?

SELECT location, ROUND(AVG(employees)) AS number_of_employees
FROM startups
GROUP BY location
HAVING number_of_employees > 500;
